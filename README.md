### Hello, nice to meet you. 👋

I ♥ the open web. Co-host <a href="https://thewebplatformpodcast.com/">The Web Platform Podcast</a>. Google Developer Expert. Film photographer and mediocre darkroom printer. Maker of sometimes interesting things. Coder of open source curiosities. Always exploring. 

Doctorate student and DM Design and Innovation Fellow @ Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University.

☕ powered, 👪 driven, working our (new) tiny 🐤🦆🐢🐇🐹🦜🐝 farm.
