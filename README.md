I ♥ the open web. Co-host <a href="https://thewebplatformpodcast.com/">The Web Platform Podcast</a>. ex-Google Developer Expert. Film photographer and mediocre darkroom printer. Maker of sometimes interesting things. Coder of open source curiosities. Always exploring. 

PhD, Designing Sustainable Systems, DM Design and Innovation Fellow, Engaged Practitioner Scholar, Assistant Professor @ Case Western Reserve University.

☕ powered, 👪 driven, working our (new) tiny 🐤🦆🐢🐇🐹🦜🐝 farm.
